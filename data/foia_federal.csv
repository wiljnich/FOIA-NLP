During the time of the government shutdown and furlough, PFPA personnel (officers and special agents) continued to protect and defend the safety of our military. Were there any PFPA personnel exempt from the furlough and government shutdown? Once the President of the United States signed the “Pay Our Military Act” all civilian Department of Defense personnel not exempt from the furlough were to be reimbursed for wages lost. Was PFPA personnel furloughed reimbursed? The bill clearly categorizes PFPA Police Officers as excepted. Thank you for your assistance. "
